# ADVANCED-PDF-COMPARATOR
  This Python web app is designed to compare two PDF files and identify whether they are identical or not. It provides an efficient way to check documents without having to go through them manually. When the two PDFs are the same, the app confirms the match instantly. If they differ, it highlights the visual differences on a page by page basis. This makes it much easier to spot even small changes such as alignment issues, spacing, formatting adjustments or modified content. The app uses image rendering techniques to show variations between the files in a clear and user friendly way. Instead of searching line by line, users can visually see where the differences occur, saving both time and effort. It is especially useful for students, researchers or professionals who work with multiple versions of documents and need a reliable method to track changes. Overall, this tool ensures accuracy, clarity and convenience in PDF comparison.
